            <h3> About us </h3>
            <p> These pages are built as part of a paper written by current and former members of the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/gravitational-wave/index.aspx">Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy - University of Birmingham</a>. The team is led by PhD students (now postdoctoral fellows) who all work on different aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy.  The paper describes the design and construction of a long-term science exhibition on gravitational waves and its use cases in both a museum and science exhibition setting.</p>

            <h3>About the Exhibit</h3>

            <p> The exhibit centres around a single large Michelson interferometer, an optical configuration which is at the heart of gravitational-wave detection. It is a scaled-down version of the real gravitational-wave observatories located around the world: <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">Advanced LIGO</a> (Louisiana and Washington State, U.S.), <a href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu/">Virgo</a> (Pisa, Italy), and <a href="https://www.geo600.org/">GEO600</a> (Hanover, Germany). New observatories are joining the global network with <a href="https://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">KAGRA</a> (Japan) beginning observations and <a href="https://www.ligo-india.in/">LIGO India</a> planned. The exhibit interferometer is constructed using lab-grade components, ensuring the design is robust over a long period of time, looks professional, and is visually attractive.
            </p>
            <!-- old version <p> The exhibit focuses on a single large Michelson interferometer at the core of the exhibit, which is scaled down version of the two LIGO and single VIRGO detector, which are at the heart of gravitational wave detection.

           <h3>What are Gravitational Waves? </h3>
           <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">Gravitational waves</a> are a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein's</a> theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General Relativity</a>. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time which cause a <a href="https://laserlabs.itch.io/stretch-and-squash">stretch and squash</a> effect, changing distances a very small amount. They are produced by some of the most violent events in the universe, such as the collisions and mergers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>. </p>
           <p>On the 14th September 2015, the two <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO</a> detectors observed the <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php">merger of two black holes for the first time</a>. This observation was the first detection of gravitational waves passing through the Earth and provided yet another <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914TestingGR/index.php">test of Einstein's General Relativity</a>. Just under two years later, <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO</a> and <a href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu/">Virgo</a> detected the first gravitational waves from the <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW170817BNS/index.php">merger of two neutron stars</a>. This merger was not only observed through gravitational waves, but also through all wavelengths of light by electromagnetic observatories around the world and in space in a <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW170817MMA/index.php">global multimessenger observing campaign</a>. </p> 

           <!-- old version<p>Gravitational waves are a consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity and are produced when dense massive objects orbit each other, allowing for conventionally, hard to detect objects to be seen. Gravitational waves stretch and squash space, similar to ripples of water on the surface of a pond, these waves travel out from the merger of dense dead stars, such as black holes and neutron stars throughout the universe. </p>
           <p>On the 14th September 2015, the two LIGO detectors observed the merger of two black holes for the first time, this proved the existence of gravitational waves and provided yet another test of Einsteins theory. Just under two years later, LIGO and VIRGO detected the first neutron star merger and provided critical information to localise the merger in the sky. This allowed the merger to be seen not only in Gravitational waves but also with every type of electromagnetic waves by conventional telescopes.</p>
